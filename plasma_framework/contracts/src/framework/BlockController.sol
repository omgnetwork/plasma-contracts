/**
* @notice Controls the logic and functions for block submissions in PlasmaFramework
* @dev There are two types of blocks: child block and deposit block
*      Each child block has an interval of 'childBlockInterval'
*      The interval is preserved for deposits. Each deposit results in one deposit block.
*      For instance, a child block would be in block 1000 and the next deposit would result in block 1001.
*
*      Only the authority address can perform a block submission.
*      Details on limitations for the authority address can be found here: https://github.com/omisego/elixir-omg#managing-the-operator-address
