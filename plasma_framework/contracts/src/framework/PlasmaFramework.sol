     * The minimum finalization period is the Plasma guarantee that all exits are safe provided the user takes action within the specified time period
     * When the child chain is rogue, user should start their exit and challenge any invalid exit within this period
     * An exit can be processed/finalized after minimum two finalization periods from its inclusion position, unless it is an exit for a deposit,
     * which would use one finalization period, instead of two
     *
     * For the Abstract Layer Design, OmiseGO also uses some multitude of this period to update its framework
     * See also ExitGameRegistry.sol, VaultRegistry.sol, and Vault.sol for more information on the update waiting time (the quarantined period)
