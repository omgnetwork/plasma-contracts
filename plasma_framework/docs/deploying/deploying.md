# Deploying the contracts with Truffle

## Migration scripts
Truffle migration scripts run in the order of the numbered prefix of the filename. The naming convention is as follows:

- 1-98: Initial setup and main contracts like PlasmaFramework, SpendingConditionRegistry, etc.
- 99: Renounce the SpendingConditionRegistry because this has to happen before any ExitGames
- 100: First ExitGame contracts
- 200: Second ExitGame contracts
- 300: payment V2 experiment contracts
- 1000: Cleanup, dev/test contracts and output
- 2000: Future extensions, new exit games, etc.
